# Comfy Fit Size

A simple set of nodes for making an image fit within a bounding box

## Nodes

There are currently a few different nodes that are all based around fitting content within a bounding box. The reasoning behind this is that I like to copy screengrab content into comfyui, and I don't want to worry about what size or aspect ratio it is. I want it to automatically be fit to something appropriate.

### Fit Size From Int

This node is the most basic. It's the basic math of fitting some content within a bounding box. Give it a width, height, and max size, and it will scale the sizes to fit in the max size.
